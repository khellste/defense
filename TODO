- Better enemy abstraction
	- Possible implementation:
		EnemyUnit, PassiveEnemyUnit, and ActiveEnemyUnit.
			Passive: like the knight, just walks forward and that's about it.
			Active: like passive, but periodically takes some action (changes direction? heals other enemy units?)


- Tweaking enemy recoil time
- Global flow (end conditions, global health, etc.)
- Enemy death animation
- New units
- New enemies
- Sound effects
- Animations for existing units (e.g. magic animation)
- Improved enemy AI to avoid being in range of defending units
